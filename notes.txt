Notes:
* the source images were made with void and cluster
* I zeroed out DC term from the source DFTs

TODO:
* show their values and DFT. as csvs? nmaybe make graphs?
* go the other way - make some white noise and multiply by inverted gaussian etc then IDFT.
* show histogram of these and V&C noise.
* show how the IDFT noise isn't 0 to 1 too
* make some different types of noise? red, blue, green, purple?
? do we need to show the average of a lot of blue noise generated or anything?
